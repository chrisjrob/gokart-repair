Thank you to [Wildseyed Cabrer](https://plus.google.com/103153642711282733992) for suggesting that I do away with the buttresses of [v1](https://github.com/chrisjrob/gokart-repair/tree/v1) and instead design a solid cylinder. 
Of particular interest was his suggestion to use pinholes around the nut hole, to force the slicing program to add reinforcement; which has now been implemented in this design.
Thank you to [Andreas Thorn](https://plus.google.com/+AndreasThorn1) for reminding me to use the $fn = 6 for the chamferring of the nut hole, as I had for the nut hole itself.
